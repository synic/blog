  I came across the following code a while ago.  I can't take credit for it, and
  I can't remember where I got it.  Oh well.  It's pretty cool nonetheless.

```python
def threaded(f):
    """
        A decorator that will make any function run in a new thread
    """
    def wrapper(*args):
        t = threading.Thread(target=f, args=args)
        t.setDaemon(True)
        t.start()

    wrapper.name = func.name
    wrapper.dict = func.dict
    wrapper.doc = func.doc

    return wrapper

def synchronized(func):
    """
        A decorator to make a function synchronized – which means only one
        thread is allowed to access it at a time
    """
    def wrapper(self,__args,*__kw):
        try:
            rlock = self._sync_lock
        except AttributeError:
            from threading import RLock
            rlock = self.dict.setdefault(‘_sync_lock‘,RLock())
        rlock.acquire()
        try:
            return func(self,__args,*__kw)
        finally:
            rlock.release()
    wrapper.name = func.name

    return wrapper

# example:

@threaded
def this_is_a_long_running_function():
    connect_to_network_and_do_a_lot_of_stuff
# any time the above function is called, it will run in a new thread
```

  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
