I've been running Ubuntu for a while now (since Warty).  I usually end up
dist-upgrading a few months early - which, thus far, has usually been a
somewhat painless ordeal.<br /><br />

Being that Feisty is about to come out, I recently upgraded two of my machines.
On my home machine, everything went absolutely fine.  No problems whatsoever.
My work machine is a different story.  About halfway through the upgrade, I was
no longer able to use my keyboard.  I  was at work... I couldn't just sit there
and wait, so I powered the box off, and turned it back on.  Yeah, GDM wouldn't
load, and I still couldn't use my keyboard.  I was forced to reinstall the
whole operating system.  I used the new Feisty CD (I'm not sure which one
exactly, my coworker downloaded it), and now everything is running
great.<br /><br />

Despite all of this, I still recommend upgrading if you're somewhat
knowledgeable (because I'm crazy like that).  I'm actually thinking that the
problems I had were to be attributed to the new keyboard I bought.  It is a
wireless (Logitech LX 710), and I'm not even sure I had it connected correctly
before the upgrade.  So yeah, you should upgrade :)

<h3>
<b>vim tip:</b> <i>Combining Commands</i>
</h3>

<p>
Most commands you can combine in vim.  <b>d</b> stands for delete, and <b>w</b>
stands for move ahead one word.  If you type <b>dw</b>, it will delete the word
that you're on (or the rest of the word if the cursor is in the middle of it).
If you want to delete the entire word even if the cursor is in the middle, you
can type <b>diw</b>.

If you want to end up in insert mode after the word is deleted, you can type
<b>cw</b> or <b>ciw</b> (<b>c</b> stands for change).

  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
