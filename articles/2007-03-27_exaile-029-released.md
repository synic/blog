  I released <a href='http://www.exaile.org/'>Exaile 0.2.9</a> today knowing that
  it has a few issues with unicode.  We've been waiting on these issues for a

I released <a href='http://www.exaile.org/'>Exaile 0.2.9</a> today knowing that
it has a few issues with unicode.  We've been waiting on these issues for a
while now, but no one has a good solution yet.  I'm hoping that with the added
users from the release, we'll get some fresh eyes on the subject.

If you're a Python programmer that knows a bit about unicode, you should hit me
up.

Also, Exaile has been chosen for the Finnish Summer of Code.  Awesome.  I'll be
able to mentor a student while he works on the project.

<p>
Many people ask about my vim settings and etc, so I've set up a repository
for my own personal vim settings and scripts.  You can install it by typing
"git clone http://git.vimtips.org/pub/vim.git && cd vim && sh woot.sh".
This will overwrite any current settings.

  <h3>Restored from VimTips archive</h3>
  <p>
  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
