Been a few days since I made a post.  I spent most of Friday in the hospital,
so I have a good excuse.  I'm still not 100%, so this post won't be all that
technical.<br /><br />

Here's what people can expect to be in the 0.2.10 release:

<ul>
<li>Modular Radio Panel.  This means people will be able to write plugins for
their favorite stream provider... for example, live365, google radio, and etc.
(the current shoutcast information will be rewritten as a plugin)</li>
<li>A complete plugin manager.  You'll be able to browse, install, and upgrade
plugins directly from the plugin manager.</li>
<li>Using gtkmozembed for things like the artist and album information pages.
Work has also been started on a plugin that will allow you to go directly to
the youtube page for the music video corresponding with the song you're
currently listening to.</li>
<li>Possible MTP device support</li>
<li>Equalizer Support</li>
</ul>

These are just a few of the changes, I'm sure.  0.2.10 is going to be fun.

<h3><b>vim tip:</b> <i>visual mode</i></h3>

<p>
Visual mode is how you can select text for deletion, copying, cutting, and etc.
You can enter visual mode by pressing <b>v</b> while in command mode.  You can
then select the text you want by moving your cursor with the directional keys
<b>h, j, k</b>, and <b>l</b>.  If you would like to select entire lines at a
time, press <b>shift+V</b>.  If you want to make vertical selections, press
<b>ctrl+v</b>.

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
