<p>I love trac.  <span class="caps">LOVE</span> it.  With the recent exaile.org
hack, however, I wanted my bugs and code to be in a place that isn&#8217;t
going anywhere soon.  I chose Launchpad.</p>

<p>I was faced with a problem &#8211; all of our bugs were in trac.  Lots and
lots of bugs.  I had to somehow migrate them from trac to Launchpad, so I wrote
up a script to do so fairly painlessly.  You use it like this:</p>

```bash
$ ./trac2lp lpusername lppassword project /path/to/trac.db
```

Here&#8217;s the script:</p>

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite
from mechanize import Browser
import sys

try:
    username = sys.argv[1]
    password = sys.argv[2]
    project = sys.argv[3]
    db_location = sys.argv[4]
except:
    print "Useage: trac2lp.py username password project trac.db"
    sys.exit(1)

br = Browser()
br.open("https://launchpad.net/+login")
br.select_form(name="login")
br["loginpage_email"] = username
br["loginpage_password"] = password
response = br.submit()

db = sqlite.connect(db_location)
cur = db.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT id, summary, reporter, description FROM "
    "ticket WHERE resolution IS NULL ORDER BY id ASC")

# Here, we can keep track of tickets that have already been processed so that
# if something goes wrong, they don’t get processed again
tickets = []
for line in open("tickets.txt").readlines():
    line = line.strip()
    tickets.append(int(line))

h = open("tickets.txt", "a")

for row in cur.fetchall():
    if int(row[0]) in tickets: continue
    h.write("%d" % row[0])

    try:
        br.open("https://launchpad.net/%s/+filebug" % project)
        br.select_form(nr=2)
        br["field.title"] = row[1]
        response = br.submit()

        br.select_form(nr=2)
        br["field.title"] = row[1]
        br["field.comment"] = "%s\n\n\n%s\n%s" % (row[2],
            "This ticket was migrated from the old trac: re #%d" % row[0],
            "Originally reported by: %s" % row[3])

        try:
            br.find_control("field.actions.this_is_my_bug").disabled = True
            control = br.find_control("field.bug_already_reported_as")
            control.items[len(control.items) – 1].selected = True
        except:
            pass
        response = br.submit(id="field.actions.submit_bug")
    except:
        pass
```

<b>Note:</b> This only migrates open tickets.  </p>

<h3><b>vim tip:</b> <i>Ron colorscheme</i></h3>

<p>
If you&#8217;re like me, you are used to having your terminal being a white
foreground on a black background.  When using vim in a terminal, I&#8217;ve
found that the default colorscheme is hard on the eyes, or just plain hard to
read with a black background.  I tried out all the schemes that Vim comes with,
and the winner is Ron.  Try it:  <code>:colorscheme ron</code>.  <span
class="caps">IMHO</span>, much better on the eyes.<br />

  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
