  <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com'>Django</a> is a "high-level Python Web
  framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design."  So
  far, I have absolutely no complaints... and much praise.

Going from never using Django to entirely rewriting my blog and converting all
the old entries took me only a few days.  I only had to write the HTML
templates and a little Python code, and Django does the rest for me, including
the entire administration panel where I can edit articles, article categories,
links and etc.

Initial impressions are this:  I can tell that this is going to be one of those
things (like VIM) that is going to make me think "why, oh why, didn't I learn
this earlier?"

I had a bit of trouble installing it on my <a
href='http://www.dreamhost.com'>Dreamhost</a> account, but nothing that wasn't
covered in their wiki (http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Django).  I
basically just had to contact support and ask them to configure my site for
Python+FCGI.  They were quick to respond and I had it working in a few hours
from begin to end.

I am <b>VERY</b> pleased at this point :)

<h3><b>vim tip:</b> <i>Django template syntax definition</i></h3>
<p>
Searching Google for helpers for Django developers, I found a few things, but
the only thing I've actually decided to use is the syntax definition file,
which you can find here: <a

  <h3>Restored from VimTips archive</h3>

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
