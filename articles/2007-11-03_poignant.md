As stated on his blog, <a href='http://stderr.ws'>Josh Simpson</a> came up with
the idea of creating a <a
href='http://gallery.menalto.com/'>Gallery/Gallery2</a> replacement in Django.
He's rounded up me and a couple other of our good friends to tackle this
project.

The idea is to fix the problems that we find in the Gallery software, to add
features that Gallery doesn't have, and to better learn Django itself.  Some of
the ideas that we've come up with are:

<ul>
<li><a href='http://phonese.cx'>Phonese.cx</a> type integration - you'll be
able to send a photo from your phone to an email address, and the photo will be
added to the album of your choice.</li>
<li>Tagging support</li>
<li>Comment support</li>
<li>Extensive search functionality</li>
</ul>

These are just a few of the ideas that we've had.  You can find them and others
at our new project page, http://www.poignant-project.org  <br /><br />
We're really excited about this project.  If you want to help, please let me know!
