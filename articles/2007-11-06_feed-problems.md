Sorry about the weird RSS problems my blog has been having.  Moving to a new
system caused all the GIDs to be different, so all the old articles showed up
as new in readers.  Also, I'm fairly new to Django, so I forgot things like
"categories" and "pub date" in the Feed class (I know, I'm an idiot), so all
the feeds showed up in the incorrect order on http://www.openclue.org

Anyway, I think I've finally gotten it all figured out, so hopefully you
shouldn't see these oddities anymore.

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
