I downloaded the new iPhone software last Friday after my coworker informed me
that there was a "Pandora Radio" application available on the AppStore.
Internet radio on your phone?  No brainer, had to have it.<br><br>

After getting everything updated and installing the app, I was also delighted
to see that it worked decently on EDGE.  However, once I got into my car and
tried to listen to some "Shiloh Radio" on the way home from work, I was
disappointed once I realized that the usual interference that I get if I don't
put the phone on "Airplane Mode" was there, only a lot worse because,
obviously, internet radio requires constant streaming from the data
network.<br><br>

Over the weekend, I waited in the Apple Store line, and purchased the new 3G
iPhone.  There are lots of reasons that I decided to do this, but the real one
is "I like to waste my money on cool gadgets"; the other reasons are mostly
just justification of this one.<br><br>

Yeah, it's got built in GPS.  The speakers are better.  The battery lasts
longer (at least, longer than my old iPhone, which probably has a pretty weak
battery at this point).  3G is pretty cool, though not *that* much faster than
EDGE.  The real kicker:  I tried Pandora in my car on the way to work this
morning just for the hell of it.  Absolutely no interference.  I haven't
determined if this is because of the new phone case design, or the 3G network
itself.  In addition to this, I noticed there is a new Last.FM app in the
AppStore!<br><br>

The iPhone has it's flaws (one of my major complaints is that there is <i>still
no non-annoying way to send and receive MMS</i>), but seriously, who cares if
you can get internet radio in your car <b>from your phone</b>.<br><br>

I may update with a more comprehensive review of the new iPhone, that is, if I
find that the differences between it and it's predecessor are worth mentioning.
