Django 1.0 is finally here!!!<br><br>

I figured I'd just announce my excitement.  So far, I've migrated two websites
to it (one being this blog, the other being a much larger app for work), and
haven't really had any problems.  Following the <a
href='http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/BackwardsIncompatibleChanges'>Backwards
Incompatable Changes</a> on their Wiki made it fairly painless.<br><br>
Congratulations to the Django Project!<br><br>
P.S.  I know I'm going to get some guff for this, but it's a breath of fresh
air to be working in Python/Django at work instead of our hacked together
CGI/Perl system.

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
