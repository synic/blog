summary:

A nice fellow emailed and asked me if I could post a monthly (possibly weekly)
roundup on Exaile 0.3 so that people can follow what's going on.  It sounded
like a good idea to me, so here's the first one.

We've pretty much ironed out the storage details, and gotten playback/playlists
figured out.  What we have now is a fully functioning media player.  The things
that are still missing are:

<ul>
<li>Preferences dialog of some sort.  We haven't even started on this, however,
I feel that the one in 0.2 was pretty well written and could probably be
used.</li>
<li>Cover art manager</li>
<li>Lyrics manager</li>
<li>Device manager plugins (for things like Ipods, other mp3 devices)</li>
<li>Visualizations</li>
<li>Rating system</li>
</ul>

With these items missing, there have been a lot of requests for an alpha
release.  I'm thinking we could probably get everything together and release
0.2.14 and 0.3alpha at the same time.  Any comments?

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
