summary:

DropBox goes public

-->

<a href='http://www.getdropbox.com'>DropBox</a> is a system that allows you to
share and sync files between multiple computers by providing an interface for
Nautilus on Linux, Finder on OS X, or Explorer on Windows.  It's kind of like
<a href='http://www.foxmarks.com'>Foxmarks</a> for Firefox, but instead of
syncing your bookmarks, it sync whatever you put in your Dropbox
directory.<br><br>

More than that, you can share certain directories with other users of DropBox.
They also provide a web interface from which you can access your files.  The
system also tracks changes to text files, and from the web interface, you can
view different revisions of each file.<br><br>
 I remember reading about this
cool system a while ago, and signed up to receive an email when they were ready
to release an email.  I received that email yesterday, and gave it a test
drive.  I was very pleased with how well it integrated with Nautilus, and with
the speed of it syncing between my computers.  I set it up on my work computer
and on my EeePC.  I could drag a picture from the work box into the shared
directory, and watch it show up on the EeePC seconds later. <br><br>
 It seems
that they are allowing anyone to sign up right now, but on my web interface, I
see that I have "invites", so I doubt it will be open forever.  Go to <a

account!

  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
