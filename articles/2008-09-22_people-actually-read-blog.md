So, according to the comments I've been getting on the Exaile 0.3 roundup
article, people actually read this blog.  A lot of the comments have been
questions or answers to previous questions in the comments, so, I've set up an
email subscription system for blog comments.  Everything is the same, except
now you'll notice that there's an "email address" field on the comment form.
Note that this field is completely optional.  If you fill it in with your valid
email address, you'll get an email anytime someone makes another comment on
that article.  In the email message, there will be a link to unsubscribe from
the topic.
