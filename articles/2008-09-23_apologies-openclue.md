Yeah.  I guess messing around with the syndication part of my blog system ended
up causing openclue.org to repull all of my old blog posts all at once.  I'm

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
