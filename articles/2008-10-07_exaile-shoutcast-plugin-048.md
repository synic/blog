<p>Some of you might have noticed that the Shoutcast plugin hasn't worked for a
while, and wasn't fixed with the 0.2.14 update.  This is because they changed
the way that their site looks, and so the plugin wasn't able to parse
it.</p>

<p>A quick look at our forums showed that someone had figured out how to fix it
(at least until they change the format again), and so I've made the changes and
released version 0.4.8 of the plugin (thanks JDorfler).</p>

Exaile 0.3 uses Shoutcasts API, so it should be less susceptible to these UI
changes.

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
