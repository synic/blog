<p>It's been longer than a week since the last roundup, so I figured it was
time.  Since the first 0.3 alpha release, the following items have been
implemented:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Smart Playlists can now be edited via the GUI</li>
<li>The beginnings of the Preferences dialog</li>
<li>Rating display, and the ability to change the rating of the currently
playing track</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Before the next alpha (and it will still be alpha), we plan on getting the
Makefile working, ratings complete, and at least a working version of the
Preferences dialog.  I'll let you know how it goes :)</p>

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
