title: Exaile 0.3.0 Weekly Tarball
publishedAt: 2008-10-17T15:51:58-07:00
tags: [Exaile]
summary: |
  Exaile 0.3.0a now has a working install target in the Makefile, so I've decided
  to start posting automated weekly tarballs for those who don't want to use bzr
  snapshots.  The first of these is located at <a
  href='http://www.exaile.org/files/weekly'>http://www.exaile.org/files/weekly</a>.
  They will be posted every Wednesday at 5:00pm.
