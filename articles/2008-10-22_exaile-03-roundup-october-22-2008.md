<p>Ok, so I posted the weekly tarball a little early, because it's got lots of
cool new stuff.  Here are the things that have been completed since the last
roundup:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Preferences dialog and all the preferences in it now actually work.  There
aren't many preferences to choose from yet, however, it'll be super easy to add
new ones.</li>
 <li>Plugin manager.  You can now enable and disable the
plugins that are currently bundled with Exaile 0.3, which include Amazon Album
Art, LastFM Album Art, AudioScrobbler, CD Playback, PythonConsole, Gnome
Multimedia Keys, LastFM Dynamic Search, Lyrics Fly, Lyrics Wiki (the lyrics
engine isn't quite ready, so for the regular user, these plugins are probably
useless), Notify, Shoutcast Radio, and Streamripper.  There is not yet a way to
install or see new/available plugins from this plugin manager yet.</li>
<li>Gotta mention Streamripper again, because up until last night Exaile 0.3
didn't yet have the Streamripper plugin</li>
 <li>New groovy method for
setting plugin preferences.  Instead of having a popup dialog for each plugin
when you click "Configure", there is a "Plugins" category in the main
preferences dialog where you can set preferences for plugins that have a
preferences pane defined (currently only streamripper and audioscrobbler have
one).</li>
 <li>LastFM Dynamic mode works if you check the dynamic playlist
option</li>
 <li>More bug fixes</li>
 </ul></p>

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
