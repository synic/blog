summary:

If you're following me on Twitter, you'll know that recently installed Windows
Vista so that I could stream Netflix to my Xbox 360.  That venture didn't quite
work out, apparently Microsoft is working with Netflix and the new Xbox update
due on November 19th will have built in Netflix support.  Updates to the
Netflix interface have caused the vmcNetflix extender for Vista Media Player to
stop working. So really, I never needed to install Vista in the first place.

 Meanwhile, with Windows installed on one of my machines, I finally
got to try out <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>.  I quite like
it.  It got me searching for a way to at least run it in Wine on Linux, and I
found this: <a
href='http://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/chromium/cxchromium_0.9.0-1_i386.deb'>cxchromium</a>.
A Crossover port of Chromium - it's basically a proof of concept for the
Crossover folks.  Here's a few links to Ubuntu .deb files: the <a
href='http://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/chromium/cxchromium_0.9.0-1_i386.deb'>i386
version</a> or the <a
href='http://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/chromium/ia32-cxchromium_0.9.0-1_amd64.deb'>amd64
version</a>.  As expected, it has quite a few issues, and I'm not even sure
I'll be using it.  I guess I'll wait for it to be released natively on Linux.
<br><br>
 .. and then I got to thinking: who says it'll be released natively
on Linux?  I admit, I'm not an avid follower of the Chrome project, but they
haven't released a truly native version of Picasa for Linux yet (the current
versions is a Wine bundle), they never did release a Linux client for Google
talk.  While I really hope there will be a native version of Chrome, I'm not
going to hold my breath.
