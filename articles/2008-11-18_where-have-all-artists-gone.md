summary: |
  What do I have to do to find a graphic artist in the OSS community?  Where do
  projects like Gnome, KDE, etc find these people?  In the few projects I've
  worked on, there's been no shortage of people that are willing to submit a few
  lines of code in a patch, or actually become a developer on the project by
  submitting more than a few lines, but graphic artists are few and far between.
  In Exaile's history, there have been 2 or 3 people that have submitted art, but
  only a few pieces.  The rest of the art is derived from these few pieces; put
  together by other users and contributed as a set.  I've looked for artists, and
  found some, and even offered to pay others, but it's hard to get anyone to
  follow through.

 <p>I wish I had the
talent myself, but I've tried, and I just can't work it out.</p>
 <p>Why
does there seem to be such a lack of this skill in our community?  Am I the
only one that has this problem?  Is because graphic artists actually do
choose OS X as their preferred operating system?  What gives?</p>

  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
