  So yesterday, I started working on putting together a 16 drive storage machine
  that will serve as a temporary backup for the holidays.  The machine in
  question has a 3ware SATA RAID controller, which in turn has a configuration
  utility which I used to set up a few volumes.  Once the configuration was
  complete, I saved it, and exited.  At this point, the controller had to clear
  the drives of data, and because all 16 drives are 1.5TB drives, it was taking
  forever.  I started this process in the morning, and by the time I left, it was
  only at around 45% complete.

<p>This morning I came in to see how far it had progressed, and I was presented
with a dialog not unlike the one you see here.  It said nothing other than "OD"
and had a button for "OK".  Yeah.  The only way this could be more awesome is
if the "OK" had a question mark after it.  </p>

  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
