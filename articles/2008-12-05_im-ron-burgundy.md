summary:

So yesterday, I started working on putting together a 16 drive storage machine
that will serve as a temporary backup for the holidays.  The machine in
question has a 3ware SATA RAID controller, which in turn has a configuration
utility which I used to set up a few volumes.  Once the configuration was
complete, I saved it, and exited.  At this point, the controller had to clear
the drives of data, and because all 16 drives are 1.5TB drives, it was taking
forever.  I started this process in the morning, and by the time I left, it was
only at around 45% complete.

<p>This morning I came in to see how far it had progressed, and I was presented
with a dialog not unlike the one you see here.  It said nothing other than "OD"
and had a button for "OK".  Yeah.  The only way this could be more awesome is
if the "OK" had a question mark after it.  </p>
