summary:

Today there was an article on Digg (<a
href='http://digg.com/hardware/10_of_the_Ugliest_Personal_Computers_Ever_Made'>read
it here</a>) that sent me down memory
 lane.  Despite it's title, "10 of the
Ugliest Personal Computers Ever Made", it's actually just a collection of
pictures from old computers, like the IBM ICS.  Reading through the
 comments
of this post, someone mentioned the TRS-80.  I remembered that my first
computer was a Tandy.  I started searching the tubes for a picture of it,
because it definitely didn't look
 like the TRS-80.

border='0'></a> I finally found it.  The Tandy 1000 - at least I'm pretty sure
this is the one.  The picture shown here is from an eBay ad. Purchased for at
the DI by my grandma for $10.00.  I was 14 years old..., which makes the year
1994, 10 years after the machine was actually created.  Not top of the line by
any means, at this time, I'm pretty sure Intel's 486 processor was out and
about.  Nevertheless, I made good use out of this machine.  Despite not having
a hard drive when purchased, my dad helped me put a 40MB drive inside the
enclosure somehow.  I messed around on it, playing old video games and etc, and
eventually saved up to buy myself a copy of <a
href='http://www.powerbasic.com/products/pbdos/'>Power Basic</a>, where I could
continue my hobby of programming, which I did, and what I do for a living today
is a direct result of this.  BASIC was not my first programming language - the
first was actually whatever language comes on a TI-82 calculator (maybe that's
BASIC too, TI BASIC rings a bell).</p>

<p>I have no idea what happened to this computer of mine.  It's gone.  I'm
having a hard time not buying this one off of eBay.  Sentimental value and etc,
you know what I mean?  I wonder if I could somehow get Linux running on an
8088.  I'm sure there's a port out there somewhere.</p>

  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
