That's right, it's been one year as of today.

This time last year I was at home twiddling my thumbs waiting for something to
happen. I wasn't allowed to go to the hospital, and I couldn't think of
anything else. It was a very nerve-wracking experience. Up until that point,
it hadn't been entirely real; I'm not sure if I had accepted it yet. That day,
though, everything changed. All I wanted to do was be there, and it was
tearing me up that I couldn't go.

It's gotten a lot better, but only after months of fighting for it.

Happy birthday, Victoria! I'm glad you're with us!
