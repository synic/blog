  After beating Enigmo in the iPhone, I was eager for more.  I'm a sucker for
  these type of games.  I downloaded the demo of the Windows version of <a
  href='http://www.pangeasoft.net/enigmo/downloads.html'>Enigmo 2</a>, and, to my
  delight, it works great out of the box in <a
  href='http://www.winehq.com'>Wine</a>!  It's got tons more doodads and etc than
  the iPhone version, so I'd say it's a perfect upgrade path if you like that
  game.

The installer works fine, but I recommend launching the Enigmo 2 application
after you have installed it with a command similar to this:

```bash
$ wine explorer /desktop=Enigmo,1024x768 \
  'c:\\Program Files\\Ideas From the Deep\\Enigmo 2 Supernova\\Enigmo 2.exe'
```

Enigmo 2 appears to have a maximum resolution of 1024x768, and this command
will allow you to run it in a Window that size.

It even works on my HP Mini 1030, which doesn't have the most fantastic video
card in the world :)
