  Don't worry, we're still here, and still hard at work.  I thought I would give
  an update since it's been quite a while since the last one.

Don't worry, we're still here, and still hard at work.  I thought I would give
an update since it's been quite a while since the last one.

We've decided that we're going to shoot hard to get a 0.3 release ready for the
August Ubuntu feature freeze.  This may mean that 0.3 doesn't have *all* the
features that 0.2.14 had, but I feel that it's got enough.  However, as a trade
off, 0.3 will have a _lot_ of other features that 0.2.14 never had.

Currently, there appear to be a lot of people already using 0.3.  User
contributions to Exaile itself are higher right now than they've ever been.
There are currently 27 user contributed or developer written plugins in the
repository.

One of our awesome users contributed a patch that enabled rating tracks by just
clicking on the appropriate star in the playlist, much like Rhythmbox does.
I've tried to do this myself a few times and have never had much success.
Gone, now, is the old rating dropdown, which leaves us with a lot of free space
in the upper right of the UI.  We haven't even discussed what might go there,
but perhaps an equalizer interface would be useful (please please please don't
take this as law, we really haven't said so much as two words about this).

Mathias Brodala has been a friend of the project.  Initially, he did German
translations, and then he was given the job of being the translation manager.
Recently, he's been learning Python and contributing with code.  Mathias, I
didn't even know you knew how to program.  What a pleasant surprise :)

Anyway, that's it for today.  Things are moving along quite nicely.  Hopefully
we can make our August goal.

  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
