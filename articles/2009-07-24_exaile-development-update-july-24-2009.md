summary: |
  Exaile development has been *very* active in the past few weeks.  We are
  working very hard to make our August goal.  As well as picking up mathbr as a
  developer, we've had quite a few contributors adding/fixing a lot of things.
  If you're like me, this screenshot makes you drool (click on it to get a larger

Exaile development has been *very* active in the past few weeks.  We are
working very hard to make our August goal.  As well as picking up mathbr as a

If you're like me, this screenshot makes you drool (click on it to get a larger

The super sexy contextual information panel you see on the left there is being
done by Guillaume Lecomte.  The new rating widget you see in the popup menu was
done by Steve Dodier.  Steve has been submitting patch after patch getting
things fixed and new things added.

Exaile 0.3 is looking better than ever.  I'm excited!

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
