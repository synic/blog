summary: |
  Next Tuesday (July 28th) starting at 14:00 GMT (7:00 am MST) the Exaile team
  will be hosting the very first Exaile bugday.  Our goal will be to hammer out
  as many bugs as we possibly can.  SiDi has set up a <a
  href='http://launchpad.net/~exaile-bugday'>Launchpad Group</a> that will have
  it's own branch (based from the 0.3 trunk) so that people wanting to
  participate will be able to commit their changes.

In order to attend, please join our IRC channel at irc.freenode.net/#exaile.
Even if you don't plan on fixing any bugs, it should be a good time (that is,
if you're a nerdy Exaile user).

If you have questions and are too lazy to get on IRC, please email our mailing

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
