  <a href='http://www.xubuntu.org'>Xubuntu</a> has been rethinking their default

<a href='http://www.xubuntu.org'>Xubuntu</a> has been rethinking their default
applications for their next release, Karmic.  Personally, I think it's great,
but not just because of the topic of this article.

They are <a
href='https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Specifications/Karmic/DefaultMusicPlayer'>considering</a>
<a href='http://www.exaile.org'>Exaile</a> for their new default music player,
and it looks like it's winning!  This isn't the first time Xubuntu has
considered Exaile.  I can't remember how long ago it happened the last time,
but for understandable reasons, <a
href='http://www.listen-project.org'>Listen</a> was chosen instead.  Exaile was
an infant at the time, and was missing a lot of the features that should be
standard in a player.

Now, however, with Exaile 0.3 progressing the way it is, I believe it can make
it.  I'll keep my fingers crossed!

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
