I'll be the first to admit (nothing wrong with being completely honest) that we
did rush it out to be in time for Karmic.  A true tribute to Linus' law,
"release early, release often".  I, for one, am really stoked that I ca now
point new users to our final .deb.  We in the dev community and the #exaile
channel on freenode have been using Exaile 0.3 betas and alphas and bzr trunk
as our main player for so long already.  It really is a *major* upgrade, and we
can't wait to share it with the rest of the OSS community.

No word on whether we made it into Karmic or not, but, even if we didn't, it'll
surely be in the next Ubuntu release, and I can't wait.
