title: Exaile 0.3.0.1 Released!
tags: Exaile, Programming, Linux, Python
publishedAt: 2009-09-08T16:23:58-07:00
summary:

This month is my company's national convention.  This combined with a secret
project I'm working on after hours means I basically have no time to work on
Exaile until October.  So, no thanks to me, Exaile 0.3.0.1 has been released.
This one is brought to you by the other members of the team, and is a bugfix
release for 0.3.0.   This includes fixing the bug that was causing 0.2.14->0.3
migration problems for most people.  Enjoy!

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
