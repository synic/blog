<p>The <a href='http://2009.utos.org'>Utah OpenSource Conference</a> went
underway yesterday.  I thought I'd share my experiences and thoughts here as
the con progresses.</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>Today I registered, and manned the <a
href='http://www.ubuntu.com'>Ubuntu</a> booth with Mike Basinger, Bryan Petty,
Matthew Washburn, and James VanTassel for the entirety of the day.  All the
laptops demonstrating Ubuntu at the booth were mine, so I wasn't very
comfortable leaving for a presentation.  Tomorrow I'll just bring my desktop,
it'll be a lot harder for someone to walk off with and I'll be able to see some
of the ones I want to see.</p>
<p>The Ubuntu booth got some pretty good participation, lots of people stopped
and either asked for more information about Ubuntu, or just to tell us what
they already knew and liked.  Lots of questions about 9.10 coming out on the
29th.  During most of the day there were about 4-5 people gathered around
talking.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>Manned the Ubuntu booth again.  Today I got to see the keynote by Stormy
Peters, which brought up some interesting aspects and some of the downsides of
being paid for work on opensource projects.  </p>
<p>I also went to Mac Newbold's presentation entitled "Why FreeBSD is the Best
Linux Distro*", which inspired me to, yet again, try to install FreeBSD as my
main operating system on my home desktop machine.  I am compiling the
x11/gnome2 port as I am typing this article.  He spent most of the time
presenting about how Linux is different from FreeBSD, rather than aspects of
why he thinks FreeBSD is actually better than Linux.  Currently, I believe that
unless you're hell bent on believing that installing packages from source is
the best way, the only compelling reason for me is the license.  I happen to
like the FreeBSD license more than the GPL.  More than that, I find FreeBSD to
be a fun challenge, much like Linux was when I first started using it.  I'll
have to see how it goes once I'm done getting everything installed - I'm pretty
determined this time to figure out all there is to figure out about using
FreeBSD as a desktop operating system.</p>

<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>Wasn't feeling well this day, so I didn't end up going.  Yes, I realize that
makes the conclusion of the article a little anti-climactic.  However, I did
end up getting Gnome in FreeBSD working well, and I'll write up what I needed
to do, how long it took, etc, in another blog entry.</p>

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
