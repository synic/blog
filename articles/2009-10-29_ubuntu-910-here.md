<a href='http://www.ubuntu.com'>Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala)</a> is out today!

I've actually been running the RC since <a
href='http://2009.utosc.com/pages/home/'>UTOSC</a> on October 9th. On my home
machine, work machine, and my HP netbook.  I really haven't had any problems on
any of them, though only one of them was an upgrade - the other two were fresh
installs.

Actually, I lied.  I've had one major problem.  <a
href='http://www.eveonline.com'>EVE Online</a> no longer works out of the box
in Karmic.  After a lot of searching, I've found that if you disable your
network connection before you start EVE, and reconnect so that you can log in,
it'll launch and work, but it's still a pain in the ass.  Hopefully they get
this resolved soon, so I can shoot some spaceships without disconnecting.

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
