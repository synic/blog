summary: |
  I bought myself the first generation iPhone about 8 days after it came out, and
  have followed the upgrade path (getting the 3G and 3Gs as soon as they were
  available) clear up until about a week and a half ago, when I jumped ship from
  AT&T.  I love the iPhone.  Sure, there are some things that bother me about it,
  but it really was good to me.  Especially now, that a lot of the features I was
  missing in a phone were suddenly there (copy & paste, MMS, etc).

<p>I bought myself the first generation iPhone about 8 days after it came out,
and have followed the upgrade path (getting the 3G and 3Gs as soon as they were
available) clear up until about a week and a half ago, when I jumped ship from
AT&T.  I love the iPhone.  Sure, there are some things that bother me about it,
but it really was good to me.  Especially now, that a lot of the features I was
missing in a phone were suddenly there (copy & paste, MMS, etc).  </p>

<p>Everything was great until I moved from SLC to Seattle, where my data plan
took a horrible turn for the worst.  Even with full bars, I could rarely access
webpages, post to twitter, read my headlines on facebook, or send an email.
AT&T was less than helpful, asking me to "restore" my iPhone to factory
settings, which didn't do much for me at all. Living in Utah, where AT&T is
grand, I really didn't ever get the reports I read about their service being
poor (<a
href='http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2009/04/iPhone_3G_network_problems_in_Seattle_44079232.html'>here's
an example</a>).  Now I do.</p>

<p>I flew back to Utah about a week before Thanksgiving to spend the holiday
with my family.  Whoop, suddenly my data service works again!  A couple of my
friends had picked up a Motorola Droid (and thus, Verizon) recently, one of
them even coming from an iPhone.  Both of them said they liked it.  One of them
(the one that switched from an iPhone) was actually in Seattle that week for
the MLS cup, and said the Verizon coverage in the city was great.  So, I jumped
on the bandwagon, and purchased a Droid.</p>

<p>Being an iPhone/AT&T user for 3 1/2 years jumping to the Droid/Verizon has
been a little rough for me.  Now, while I realize that a week and a half is a
pretty short time to develop a great opinion of the Droid, I'm pretty sure I've
got a fairly good grasp of it.  Here are the pros and the cons for a user
switching from the iPhone to a Droid - I'm listing the cons first since I'm
sure those will be the ones people will want to look at first if they are
considering the change:</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Verizon's Visual voicemail app pales in comparison to the one provided by
  Apple/AT&T.  Here's why:
    <ul>
    <li>Constant notifications that a connection could not be made to the
    visual voicemail service.  I get one each time I boot up the phone - I
    assume this is because the background service of the app starts before the
    network connection is made.  I also get them randomly througought the this
    day.</li>
<li>The service costs $2.99</li>
    <li>You cannot listen to or delete Visual Voicemail messages while
    connected to a Wireless network.  If you try to do so, the application will
    completely shut down your wireless connection, and it won't bring it back
    up automatically when you're done.  </li>
    <li>The app itself looks like it was made in 1999.  The
    buttons/widgets/gradients are low resolution and generally look like crap.
    Take a look at the screenshots below and you'll see what I mean.</li>
    </ul>

<li>The Android API itself seems to have a lot less in the way of user
interface design standards and stock icons.  There's not really a common theme
between different apps on the phone, let alone in the apps on available in the
Android Market.  The SMS has nice clean dark theme, while the Camera app
appears as though it was designed to look like it was made out of brushed
granite.  A lot of the apps on the market have buttons with weird fonts, weird
colors, and weird layout positioning.  Everything on the iPhone is pretty
seemless, and in most cases, has a unified design that's familiar when
switching from application to application.</i>

<li>Games.  There are probably 10 games in the Android Market that are worth
purchasing.  No "Worms", no "Doom Ressurection", no "Super Monkey Ball".  I
think you get the point.  Sure, there weren't many great games for the iPhone
when the app store and SDK first arrived, but the simple fact is, Android
doesn't have them <i>now</i>.</li>

<li>You cannot surf the web and be on a phone call at the same time. </li>

<li>I don't know if it's Verizon's network, or the Droid itself, but SMS
messages have a hard limit of 160 characters.  I know that this is the SMS
standard, but somehow the iPhone gets around it.  Whether it pieces multiple
SMSes together when recieving, or it splits long ones into multiple packets
when delivering, it doesn't really matter.  With the iPhone, you really don't
need to worry about the length of your SMS.  <br /><br />

Composing an SMS longer than 160 characters on the Droid and sending it to a
contact on another network will result in the message being truncated to 160
characters.  There is no automatic splitting, the contact simply will not
recieve the entire message.
<br /><br />
There's an SMS replacement app on the Android Market that'll automatically
split any SMS that's longer than 160 characters, but while using it, the alerts
I get from our Nagios server via Verizon's email to SMS gateway are still
truncated at 160 characters, making the messages fairly useless to me.  The app
is also terribly ugly, suffering from UI weirdness like I described in number
2.</li>

<li>No pinch to zoom in the built in browser.  I have seen it on the Eris, and
it even works in a 3rd party browser called "Dolphin", so it's not the hardware
that's causing this limitation, but the functionality definitely is not present
in the Droid's default browser.</li>

<li>The Micro SD card system.  You cannot store apps on the included 16GB SD
card.  You can only store them in the 256MB built in storage.  Possibly because
of security reasons?  I don't know.  Apps can <i>access</i> data on the SD
card, which probably makes all of this a moot point.  All of the gigantic apps
I used on the iPhone consumed their space using data that could probably be
downloaded to the SD card after the app is installed and launched for the first
time.  For instance, Doom Ressurection (50mb or so if I remember correctly),
and the TomTom app (1.7GB).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pros</h2>
<ol>
<li>The obvious.  Verizon's data network actually works where I live.</li>

<li>Multitasking.  I love how Android does this.  I love that you can keep
applications open, and switch around between them at will.  Sure, the iPhone's
hardware supports this, and some of Apple's apps even make use of it, but this
stuff has been purposely left out of the public SDK.  The only way around it is
to Jailbreak.
<br /><br />
With Android, it's more than just having multiple applications running at the
same time.  The SDK also allows you to create services that run in the
background.  Services that can use Android's cool notification system to alert
you of things, which brings us to:</li>

<li>The notification system.  Google has created a way for applications to
alert you in a non-obtrusive and super useful way.  The statusbar at the top of
the screen can display little icons and little blurbs of text when something of
interest happens.  A simple swipe of the finger and you can see a list of
recent notifications; tap on one and you can switch to the application that
cause the notification.  The iPhone has nothing like this.  It has "badges" and
alert windows (which are most definitely NOT non-obtrusive). </li>

<li>The keyboards.  Both of them.  I like the physical keyboard because, well,
it's a physical keyboard.  Yes, the keys are a bit cramped, but I did get used
to it eventually.  The software keyboard is somewhat better than the one on the
iPhone.  It does everything that the iPhone's does, but the autocorrection is a
LOT better, simply because it provides you a list of words to choose from, and
allows you to click on the one you like the most instead of always just picking
one for you (though it'll do that too if you opt not to pick one).</li>

<li>The Android Market (app store) policies.  There basically are none.  I've
done a touch of iPhone development, and I can tell you that Apple will most
likely NOT approve an app if it doesn't somehow help their bottom line.  If
you're trying to sell a service with your app, direct business to your website,
etc, then good luck.  If you're trying to duplicate functionality that's
already present on the iPhone, even if you think you can do it better, good
luck with that too.  </li>

<li>More on the SDK:  Android allows you to replace system components.  Don't
like the built in software keyboard?  You can replace it with one from the App
store.  You can route phonecalls through the Google Voice App.  You can replace
the SMS app entirely with a new one.  You can replace the Home screen with a
new one.  You can cause an app to start when another one starts: for instance,
the Last.FM app will start and scrobble your music automatically when you open
Android's music player.
<br /><br />
Also, you don't need to buy a Mac to write Android applications.  You can write
them completely for free using the operating system of your choice.  </li>

<li>You can download applications from random websites, bypassing the Android
market all together.  Find a link to a sweet app?  Just click from the Android
Browser and it'll download and install for you.  No way in hell Apple would let
this type of thing happen.  How would they get any money this way?</li>

<li>Mass storage capability for the SD card.  You can simply mount the SD card
on your computer (running any OS that supports Mass Storage) and copy your
music/videos over.  You aren't stuck using iTunes to get music on the phone.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Some other notes:  </h2>
<ol>
<li>ConnectBot, the SSH client on the Android platform, is quite a bit better
than the options on the iphone.  It supports your screen+irssi+nicklist.pl
session quite nicely.  It's fast.  It resizes the terminal contents corretly.
With the physical keyboard, your input method isn't getting in the way.</li>

<li>Android lacks the super sweet TomTom app that the iPhone app store has,
though it does include Google Navigation.  Google navigation is fine, however,
you cannot use it in areas where there is low or no signal because it transfers
map data over the air as you drive.  The TomTom app on the iPhone takes up
about 1.7GB of your precious music space, so there's a downside to that as
well.
<br /><br />
Another thing about Google Navigation is that it doesn't automatically shut
down when you get a phone call.  I found this out the hard way, answering a
phone call, only to have the other person get talked over by the
computerized voice trying to give me driving directions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Switching from iPhone OS to Android reminds me a whole lot of when I switched
from Windows to Linux years ago.  I feel like I've switched to the better
platform that isn't quite ready yet.  A lot of the apps feel like they were
written by programmers who have never heard of the word "aesthetic".  Android
isn't quite as pretty as the iPhone OS.  It doesn't have core animation.  It
certainly doesn't have the great team of graphic designers that Apple has.  It
is open, though, less restrictive, and it shows.  To me, that openness is more
important than the pretty looks, so even if AT&T <i>did</i> work well where I
live, knowing what I know now, I'd probably still consider switching.  I hate
the feeling I get from Apple's greedy SDK rules and restrictions.
