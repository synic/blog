title: SupaCount: Android Multi-Countdown App

summary:

So, I got a Droid, which for me, meant that I had to start learning the <a
href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK</a>.  In my
opinion, the best way to learn something like this is to write an application.
It's how <a href='http://www.exaile.org'>Exaile</a> and <a
href='http://www.jbother.org'>JBother</a> came to be, and now, it's how
SupaCount came to be.

<p>So, I got a Droid, which for me, meant that I had to start learning the <a

SupaCount came to be.</p>

<p>I've always wanted a countdown application that would allow you to run more
than one countdown at a time, and save them for later use, so that's exactly
what SupaCount does.  You can save multiple countdowns, and run any number of
them at the same time.  When a countdown is done, you can have it alert you,
optionally by blinking the LED, vibrating, and playing a notification ringtone.
You can specify how long the alarm will last before it stops on it's own (to
save your battery).</p>

<p>I decided to publish it here before I publish it to the market.  It uses the
Apache 2.0 OpenSource License.  Here are download options, should you be
interested:

  can pick it up from there.</li>

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
