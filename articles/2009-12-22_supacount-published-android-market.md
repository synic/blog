summary: |
  SupaCount 0.1.0 published to the Android Market.  I don't suspect that it'll be
  a highly successful app, being that it's a utility that most people won't need.
  However, being my first app on any of the mobile markets, it'll be interesting
  to see what happens.  There are, at the very least, hundreds of thousands of
  people (200,000+ people bought a Motorola Droid the first week it was released)
  with access to the market.

My first impressions of the Android SDK were just from using the platform
itself.  It seemed great then, just because of the results I could see by
installing other applications (the open nature of it, the ability to replace
system components, etc), but now that I've actually taken a further look at the
internals, I like it even more.  It encourages you (if not requires you) to
create highly modular applications.

Along the way, I found a great book that I'd like to recommend if you're
thinking about getting in on Android development.  <a
href='http://commonsware.com/'>"The Busy Coder's Guide to Android
Development"</a>.  If you buy it at it's very reasonable price, you get free
updates to the book when there are new releases of the SDK.  They also have
kind of a community editing thing going on, you can join the mailing list and
add "patches" to the book if you feel so inclined.  You also get "The Busy
Coders Guide to Advanced Android Development".

*Edit (12-22-2009 @ 11:11pm)*:  After one day, the market reports 120 active
installs.

*Edit (12-29-2009 @ 7:20am)*: After eight days, the market reports 272 total
installs, and 172 active installs for a 63% retention rate.  The average rating
is 4 1/2 stars.  So, even though not many people kept it installed, those that
did rated it highly.  This is about what I thought would happen, just because a
multi-countdown timer isn't an app that many people would really need.  I think
I'll get more success if I implement a one off timer that doesn't require you
to save it before you run it.  This will give it the same feature set as any
other countdown timer, plus more.

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
