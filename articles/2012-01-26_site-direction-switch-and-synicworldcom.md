I haven't posted in forever.  I have a bunch of things I want to post about,
though, and I will continuing forward.

Thing is, a lot of these things I want to write about having absolutely nothing
to do with the tech world, and I didn't feel that it was appropriate to post
non-techy things on "vimtips.org".

So, I've registered a new domain, called http://synicworld.com, and that will
be the new face of this blog.  vimtips.org will still go here too, for now.
Anyone want to buy it? :)

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
