I posted [SupaCount](http://bitbucket.org/synic/supacount) to the
Android market. Shortly after that, I stopped posting updates for three
years.

The reason for this? I lost my signing key. Even if I wanted to make
updates to it, I couldn't upload it to the same project on the Android
Market, at least, not without a lot of grief. So, I just avoided it...
though it wasn't a huge problem. Since I uploaded it, I haven't gotten
one error report in the market dashboard, so it must be working.
However, during that time using it myself, I noticed a few features I've
wanted here or there that would just make things easier.

So, over the weekend, I rewrote the entire app in Scala. Why a rewrite?
I dunno, just because I wanted an excuse to learn Scala and Scala for
Android. I've named this one "DupaCount". "SupaCount" will remain on the
market, but with a blurb that it's been replaced. During the rewrite, I
added the few features that I wanted:

-   If you reboot the phone while a timer is running, it will still
    alert as expected. This one really is more of a bug, but people
    probably didn't notice as most wouldn't make a timer that runs
    longer than a few hours. I've run timers for up to 2 months before,
    and though they always kept counting down, they wouldn't always
    alert if I had rebooted during that time.
-   There is an easy to see & access button at the bottom of the main
    screen called "Add Timer"
-   The "description" field in the Add Timer dialog has been made
    optional. If you leave it blank, it will default to a display of the
    timer time. This will make it much easier to add a timer.

Anyway, the app can be found here:
<https://market.android.com/details?id=com.synicworld.dupacount>, and the
sourcecode can be found here: <http://bitbucket.org/synic/dupacount>
