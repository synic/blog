Due to the recent news Regarding Stallman's heart attack, I ended up on the
wikipedia page for The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and I was reading the
"Guidelines for creating good opensource software".  Number 3 says:

"When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to
a competent successor."

I have shirked my duty.  I should have done this a long time ago.  It's not
necessarily that I have lost interest, though that is part of it (I've gone the
route of cloud music, such as spotify and google music), I really don't have
the time anymore.

Had I done this a year or two ago, I can think of a few people who would have
taken the reins.  Now, though, there's hardly anyone left who has any time
anymore.  Perhaps everyone is going the route of cloud music, I have no idea.

Anyway, I posted a "help wanted" listing of sorts, asking for someone to step
up as the team leader.  We'll see where that leads us :)

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
