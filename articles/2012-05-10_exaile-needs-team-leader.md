Due to the recent news Regarding Stallman's heart attack, I ended up on the
wikipedia page for The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and I was reading the
"Guidelines for creating good opensource software".  Number 3 says:

"When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to
a competent successor."

I have shirked my duty.  I should have done this a long time ago.  It's not
necessarily that I have lost interest, though that is part of it (I've gone the
route of cloud music, such as spotify and google music), I really don't have
the time anymore.

Had I done this a year or two ago, I can think of a few people who would have
taken the reins.  Now, though, there's hardly anyone left who has any time
anymore.  Perhaps everyone is going the route of cloud music, I have no idea.

Anyway, I posted a "help wanted" listing of sorts, asking for someone to step
up as the team leader.  We'll see where that leads us :)

  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
