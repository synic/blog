Welp, my simple human test, where you had to type "vim" to enter comments on
this blog, finally failed to keep out the spam.  Surprisingly, it did work for
6 years before I had problems.

Over the weekend, there was a steady stream of spam to the comments.
Fortunately, I don't get a lot of comments, so removing all comments after a
certain date was sufficient.

I installed this to combat the problem:
<https://django-simple-captcha.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>

Installation and usage is very simple.  We'll see how it goes from here.

  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably
  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it
  was still important to me to bring them back.
