summary: |
  At the beginning of 2022, I decided I was going to learn photography. I always
  enjoyed taking photos with my phone, and before that, with various point and
  shoot cameras. I had also been avoiding something like a DSLR because they are
  so large and bulky. These days, though, mirrorless cameras are pretty compact,
  so I went for it.

At the beginning of 2022, I decided I was going to learn photography. I always
enjoyed taking photos with my phone, and before that, with various point and
shoot cameras. I had also been avoiding something like a DSLR because they are
so large and bulky. These days, though, mirrorless cameras are pretty compact,
so I went for it.

Prior to making my purchase, I decided I would start with macro photography.
I've always enjoyed nature, and insects in particular. There's plenty of them
as well. In 2022, I took hundreds of photos and posted them on
[Instagram](https://instagram.com/synic.dev?theme=dark).

I took far less photos in 2023, but, in my opinion, they were much better
quality.<br>

This is one of my favorites, taken here in Murray, Utah. This is a Bicolored
Striped Sweat Bee. Super lucky shot, this bee was darting all over the place,
like bees do, and I just happened to catch it at the right moment:

Margined Shining Leaf Chafer that I found in Ft Lauderdale:

This is some sort of Cuckoo Bee. They sleep by biting onto a leaf or something
and just hanging there!

This is another sleeping bee, a type of Longhorn bee native to Utah here:
