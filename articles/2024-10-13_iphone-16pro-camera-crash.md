summary:

Is your iPhone 16 Pro or Max camera crashing every time you try to use it? Mine
was too, but I have found a fix.

I rely on my phone camera a lot more than I realized. I found this out because
the new iphone has a real problem with the camera crashing atm (iOS 18.0.1).
I've seen lots of posts about it with no real solutions, and I've called Apple
support about it. They didn't seem to know any more than anyone else.

The problem seems to stem from updating from an earlier iPhone, while using an
iCloud backup. This makes sense because not everyone has the issue; this is
probably because not everyone upgrades using a backup.

What worked for me was going to `Settings->General->Transfer or Reset
iPhone->Reset->Reset All Settings`. Note that this does reset all the iPhone
settings, but does NOT delete your data.

It's a little annoying because you need to set up everything again, but it
seems to fix the camera crash. For me, this was worth it. Maybe it'll be worth
it for you too?

## UPDATE: October 15, 2024

This seems to fix all of the issues I was having with the iPhone 16 Pro,
including intermitten performance, battery drain, and overheating (it stands to
reason they are all related, but who knows)
