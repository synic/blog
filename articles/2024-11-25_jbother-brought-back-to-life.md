15 years or so ago, I abandoned my first opensource project,
[JBother](https://github.com/synic/JBother) and eventually let the domain
expire. However, someone, I have no idea who, has rehosted the site, with my
design, etc, with very little modifications. Whoever did it has not contacted
me at all.

What is going on here?

In 2003, I released my very first opensource project,
[JBother](https://github.com/synic/JBother). A Jabber client, written in Java.

It was an awesome experience. I learned a lot of Java, Swing, and a lot about
the jabber protocol itself. _Other people_ wanted to use it, which felt pretty
good, I have to say.

I used it to talk to everyone. It supported a lot of advanced jabber features,
like groupchat and transport registration (which meant it supported AIM, MSN
Messenger, etc). Eventually, several other programmers became interested and
started contributing. UCLA started using it. It was _somewhat_ popular,
as far as jabber clients go.

Eventually, jabber seemed to go out of style, and Google Talk removed support
for it, making it a lot less useful for me. I continued to support it for a few
more years until all interest died off, and then I stopped working on it.
Eventually I just let the domain expire.

# Someone Else Has Taken Over?

The other day I was looking for screenshots of it, and found that the main
site, https://jbother.org was back, and looked nearly identical to the site I
had abandoned. The whois info shows nameservers that I've never used before.

It's serving up a single release, `JBother-0.8.9.jar`, the last
one I ever made. However, I have no idea if the jar file is the one I made, or
something full of malware. I've downloaded the file and looked over the
archive, but it's been so long I can't tell what was there originally or what
might be new. The oldest timestamp in the file is 2006, which is probably
about correct, but who knows if the timestamps are spoofed. If this person
wanted to take over the project, why didn't they contact me?

I really have no way of verifying that it's really my release or something
else.

Pretty strange!
