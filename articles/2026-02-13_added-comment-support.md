slug: added-comment-support

summary: |
  The blog has officially been given comment support. While the articles
  themselves are markdown files in the repository and are pre-rendered to json
  during the build process, the comments are stored in a database.
  Authentication is provided by GitHub OAuth.

  For the time being, I'm going to have it so that I need to approve comments
  when they are posted. Hopefully with the GitHub OAuth requirement there won't
  be too much spam. Guess we shall find out - that was the reason I removed
  comment support in the first place.

  Unfortunately, I no longer have the comments from older vimtips.org articles.
  Not sure what happened to them. I guess when I turned them off I forgot to back
  them up. Oh well 😉
