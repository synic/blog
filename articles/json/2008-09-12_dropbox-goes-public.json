It's kind of like\n\u003ca href='http://www.foxmarks.com'\u003eFoxmarks\u003c/a\u003e for Firefox, but instead of\nsyncing your bookmarks, it sync whatever you put in your Dropbox\ndirectory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than that, you can share certain directories with other users of DropBox.\nThey also provide a web interface from which you can access your files.  The\nsystem also tracks changes to text files, and from the web interface, you can\nview different revisions of each file.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI remember reading about this\ncool system a while ago, and signed up to receive an email when they were ready\nto release an email.  I received that email yesterday, and gave it a test\ndrive.  I was very pleased with how well it integrated with Nautilus, and with\nthe speed of it syncing between my computers.  I set it up on my work computer\nand on my EeePC.  I could drag a picture from the work box into the shared\ndirectory, and watch it show up on the EeePC seconds later. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt seems\nthat they are allowing anyone to sign up right now, but on my web interface, I\nsee that I have \u0026quot;invites\u0026quot;, so I doubt it will be open forever.
