I should have done this a long time ago.  It's not\nnecessarily that I have lost interest, though that is part of it (I've gone the\nroute of cloud music, such as spotify and google music), I really don't have\nthe time anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I done this a year or two ago, I can think of a few people who would have\ntaken the reins.  Now, though, there's hardly anyone left who has any time\nanymore.  Perhaps everyone is going the route of cloud music, I have no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I posted a \u0026quot;help wanted\u0026quot; listing of sorts, asking for someone to step\nup as the team leader.
