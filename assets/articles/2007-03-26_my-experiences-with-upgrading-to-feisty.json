No problems whatsoever.\nMy work machine is a different story.  About halfway through the upgrade, I was\nno longer able to use my keyboard.  I  was at work... I couldn't just sit there\nand wait, so I powered the box off, and turned it back on.  Yeah, GDM wouldn't\nload, and I still couldn't use my keyboard.  I was forced to reinstall the\nwhole operating system.  I used the new Feisty CD (I'm not sure which one\nexactly, my coworker downloaded it), and now everything is running\ngreat.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all of this, I still recommend upgrading if you're somewhat\nknowledgeable (because I'm crazy like that).  I'm actually thinking that the\nproblems I had were to be attributed to the new keyboard I bought.  It is a\nwireless (Logitech LX 710), and I'm not even sure I had it connected correctly\nbefore the upgrade.  So yeah, you should upgrade :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='vimtip'\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cb\u003evim tip:\u003c/b\u003e \u003ci\u003eCombining Commands\u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nMost commands you can combine in vim.  \u003cb\u003ed\u003c/b\u003e stands for delete, and \u003cb\u003ew\u003c/b\u003e\nstands for move ahead one word.
