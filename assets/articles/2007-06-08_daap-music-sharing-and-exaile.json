If this\nyour first time running Exaile, you will be prompted to add some directories to\nyour collection.  Do this, and wait for it to complete scanning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen up a terminal, and type \u003ccode\u003etangerine-properties\u003c/code\u003e.

This will start Tangerine,  which will\nbegin serving up music from Exaile\u0026#8217;s library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Exaile, go to Tools-\u003ePlugins and select the \u0026#8220;Available\nPlugins\u0026#8221; tab.  When the list finishes loading (which can take a minute),\nselect the checkbox next to the \u0026#8220;Music Sharing\u0026#8221; plugin, and click\nthe \u0026#8220;Install/Upgrade\u0026#8221; button.  Close the plugin manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will now see a new tab on the left called \u0026#8220;Network\u0026#8221;.  In the\ndropdown at the top, you should see your local tangerine share (which will be\nan IP and a port number, something like 66.79.34.24:52106), and then\n\u0026#8220;Custom Location\u0026#8221;.   If you are working in an office with people\nwho are running iTunes, you might also see their shares.  You can connect to\nany of these, so long as you have the password, and browse them like they were\nyour own collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if you write down that IP and port for your local share, when you get\nhome from your office, you can follow this guide again to get Tangerine and\nExaile up and running, choose \u0026#8220;Custom Location\u0026#8221; from the dropdown\nin network, and type the IP and port of your work share.  \u003cspan\nclass=\"caps\"\u003eAWESOME\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote, this assumes that you don\u0026#8217;t have a firewall at work\u0026#8230; you\nmay need to forward a port or something, but I\u0026#8217;ll leave that part to you.\nThe hard part is done\u0026#8230;. thanks Aren!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='vimtip'\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003evim tip:\u003c/b\u003e \u003ci\u003eSetting up Vi keybindings in bash\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nIf you\u0026#8217;re like me, you\u0026#8217;re constantly ending up with sequences\nlike this in your firefox address bar or at the command line in bash:\n\u003ccode\u003eciw\u003c/code\u003e.  That\u0026#8217;s right, I\u0026#8217;m trying to change the word that\nmy cursor is under.  It\u0026#8217;s quite annoying.  Well, you can actually do this\nin bash.  Open up a terminal, and type \u003ccode\u003eset -o vi\u003c/code\u003e.  You now have Vi\nkeybindings in \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eBASH\u003c/span\u003e.  Note, that unlike in Vi, you\nare in insert mode by default.  To enter command mode, you have to type escape.\nMost commands work here\u0026#8230; but there are a lot of exceptions.  If the\ncommand you\u0026#8217;re typing is getting complex, you can open an actual vi\nscreen for the command you\u0026#8217;re typing by hitting the v key.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
