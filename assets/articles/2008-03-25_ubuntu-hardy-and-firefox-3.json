I found that, by default, the -386 kernel was set as default\ninstead of the -generic kernel.  The -386 kernel does not come with snd-*\nmodules for some reason.  I edited \u003ccode\u003e/boot/grub/menu.lst\u003c/code\u003e and changed \u003ccode\u003edefault  0\u003c/code\u003e\nto \u003ccode\u003edefault  2\u003c/code\u003e, which made it so the -generic kernel would load by default.\nThis fixed my sound issues.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFirefox 3 Issues:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than missing extensions that are not yet compatable with Firefox 3, I've\nreally only had one really annoying problem.  This problem existed in Gutsy\nwhen trying to upgrade to FF3, and remained once the upgrade to Hardy was\ncomplete (Hardy comes with FF3 by default).  The problem is as follows:  If you\nhave Firefox on workspace one, and you click on a link in a terminal (or any\nother application) on a different workspace, the entire firefox window moves to\nthat workspace (even if you have FF set to open links in a new tab).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr\n/\u003e\nGoogling for answers to this problem revealed nothing, and people in\nirc.mozilla.org/#firefox couldn't really understand what I meant.  Asking in\nirc.freenode.net/#ubuntu-us-ut, Christer Edwards informed me that he had the\nsame problem and that in a fresh install of Hardy (as opposed to an upgrade)\nthe problem did not exist.  After fiddling around for a bit, I found that a\nsimple \u003ccode\u003erm -rf ~/.mozilla\u003c/code\u003e fixed the problem.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nI will keep posting\nas other issues may or may not arise with the upgrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
