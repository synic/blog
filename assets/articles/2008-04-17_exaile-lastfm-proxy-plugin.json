This is a program\nwritten in python created to connect to LastFM and start streaming the music to\na proxy that you can connect to on your local machine using any music player\nthat supports HTTP streaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a bit of hacking (and really,\nthis is some seriously hackish stuff), I've created a plugin for Exaile called\n\u0026quot;LastFM Radio\u0026quot; that (mostly) seemlessly integrates LastFMProxy into Exaile.  To\nthe user, it appears to just be a Radio Panel plugin like the current\n\u0026quot;Shoutcast Radio\u0026quot; plugin.  The user just clicks on the station they want to\nlisten to, and it starts playing.  They can \u0026quot;Skip\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Ban\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;Love\u0026quot; tracks\njust like in the LastFM native player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt still needs some work, but overall, I'm pretty pleased with how well it\nworks.  Give it a try!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote:  You must be using the latest bzr version of Exaile for this plugin to\nwork.  You can get instructions on doing that from Exaile's \u003ca\nhref='http://www.exaile.org/downloads'\u003edownloads\u003c/a\u003e page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
