No brainer, had to have it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting everything updated and installing the app, I was also delighted\nto see that it worked decently on EDGE.  However, once I got into my car and\ntried to listen to some \u0026quot;Shiloh Radio\u0026quot; on the way home from work, I was\ndisappointed once I realized that the usual interference that I get if I don't\nput the phone on \u0026quot;Airplane Mode\u0026quot; was there, only a lot worse because,\nobviously, internet radio requires constant streaming from the data\nnetwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the weekend, I waited in the Apple Store line, and purchased the new 3G\niPhone.  There are lots of reasons that I decided to do this, but the real one\nis \u0026quot;I like to waste my money on cool gadgets\u0026quot;; the other reasons are mostly\njust justification of this one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it's got built in GPS.  The speakers are better.  The battery lasts\nlonger (at least, longer than my old iPhone, which probably has a pretty weak\nbattery at this point).  3G is pretty cool, though not \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e much faster than\nEDGE.  The real kicker:  I tried Pandora in my car on the way to work this\nmorning just for the hell of it.  Absolutely no interference.  I haven't\ndetermined if this is because of the new phone case design, or the 3G network\nitself.  In addition to this, I noticed there is a new Last.FM app in the\nAppStore!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe iPhone has it's flaws (one of my major complaints is that there is \u003ci\u003estill\nno non-annoying way to send and receive MMS\u003c/i\u003e), but seriously, who cares if\nyou can get internet radio in your car \u003cb\u003efrom your phone\u003c/b\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may update with a more comprehensive review of the new iPhone, that is, if I\nfind that the differences between it and it's predecessor are worth mentioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
