Everything is the same, except\nnow you'll notice that there's an \u0026quot;email address\u0026quot; field on the comment form.\nNote that this field is completely optional.  If you fill it in with your valid\nemail address, you'll get an email anytime someone makes another comment on\nthat article.  In the email message, there will be a link to unsubscribe from\nthe topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
