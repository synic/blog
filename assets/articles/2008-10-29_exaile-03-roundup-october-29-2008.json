It was actually Aren's\nidea that, from the beginning, we should create pluggable interfaces for things\nlike dynamic playlists, album art, lyrics, devices, and etc.  This means that\nalbum art support wouldn't be hard coded to one place like Amazon, but anyone\ncould add a plugin to support album art from anywhere.  Currently, there are\nthree album art plugins:  local search, which checks local directories for\nimage names like 'cover.jpg' and etc., Amazon, and Last.FM.  The idea is that\neach plugin will be searched in order until something is found.  Also Aren's\nidea: the order that each plugin is searched should be user definable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, this week's tarball includes the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eAlbum\nArt Manager (it's basically just like the old one)\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003ePreferences page\nto allow you to drag and drop the album art search methods\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src='/media/images/screenie.jpg'\nalt='Screenshot of album art preferences' border='0' /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\n Also, I've\nuploaded the current Exaile 0.3 \u003ca href='http://www.exaile.org/doc'\u003eAPI\nDocumentation\u003c/a\u003e.
