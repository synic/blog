So really, I never needed to install Vista in the first place.\u003cbr\n/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nMeanwhile, with Windows installed on one of my machines, I finally\ngot to try out \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\"\u003eChrome\u003c/a\u003e.  I quite like\nit.  It got me searching for a way to at least run it in Wine on Linux, and I\nfound this: \u003ca\nhref='http://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/chromium/cxchromium_0.9.0-1_i386.deb'\u003ecxchromium\u003c/a\u003e.\nA Crossover port of Chromium - it's basically a proof of concept for the\nCrossover folks.  Here's a few links to Ubuntu .deb files: the \u003ca\nhref='http://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/chromium/cxchromium_0.9.0-1_i386.deb'\u003ei386\nversion\u003c/a\u003e or the \u003ca\nhref='http://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/chromium/ia32-cxchromium_0.9.0-1_amd64.deb'\u003eamd64\nversion\u003c/a\u003e.  As expected, it has quite a few issues, and I'm not even sure\nI'll be using it.  I guess I'll wait for it to be released natively on Linux.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n.. and then I got to thinking: who says it'll be released natively\non Linux?  I admit, I'm not an avid follower of the Chrome project, but they\nhaven't released a truly native version of Picasa for Linux yet (the current\nversions is a Wine bundle), they never did release a Linux client for Google\ntalk.  While I really hope there will be a native version of Chrome, I'm not\ngoing to hold my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
