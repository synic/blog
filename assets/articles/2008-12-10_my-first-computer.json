Despite it's title, \"10 of the\nUgliest Personal Computers Ever Made\", it's actually just a collection of\npictures from old computers, like the IBM ICS.  Reading through the\n comments\nof this post, someone mentioned the TRS-80.  I remembered that my first\ncomputer was a Tandy.  I started searching the tubes for a picture of it,\nbecause it definitely didn't look\n like the TRS-80.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href='/media/images/tandy.jpg'\u003e\u003cimg style='margin-right: 10px'\nalign='left' src='/media/images/tandy.jpg' width='200' height='148'\nborder='0'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e I finally found it.  The Tandy 1000 - at least I'm pretty sure\nthis is the one.  The picture shown here is from an eBay ad. Purchased for at\nthe DI by my grandma for $10.00.  I was 14 years old..., which makes the year\n1994, 10 years after the machine was actually created.  Not top of the line by\nany means, at this time, I'm pretty sure Intel's 486 processor was out and\nabout.  Nevertheless, I made good use out of this machine.  Despite not having\na hard drive when purchased, my dad helped me put a 40MB drive inside the\nenclosure somehow.  I messed around on it, playing old video games and etc, and\neventually saved up to buy myself a copy of \u003ca\nhref='http://www.powerbasic.com/products/pbdos/'\u003ePower Basic\u003c/a\u003e, where I could\ncontinue my hobby of programming, which I did, and what I do for a living today\nis a direct result of this.  BASIC was not my first programming language - the\nfirst was actually whatever language comes on a TI-82 calculator (maybe that's\nBASIC too, TI BASIC rings a bell).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what happened to this computer of mine.  It's gone.  I'm\nhaving a hard time not buying this one off of eBay.  Sentimental value and etc,\nyou know what I mean?  I wonder if I could somehow get Linux running on an\n8088.  I'm sure there's a port out there somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
