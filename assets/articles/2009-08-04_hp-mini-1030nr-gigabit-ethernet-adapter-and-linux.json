They are sleek, lightweight, and they don't have a\nwonkey keyboard layout like some netbooks (I'm looking at you, ASUS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne problem: the onboard nic controller (Marvell 88E8040 adapter, sky2 kernel\nmodule) doesn't quite work right on a default install of Ubuntu 9.04.\nSometimes it works, sometimes it's not even detected (you can't see it listed\nwhen you type @lspci@).  Sometimes it's detected, and works, but locks the\nmachine up if you unplug your network cable.  Not cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some digging around, I found that there is an easy way to fix this.  Edit\n\u003ccode\u003e/boot/grub/menu.list\u003c/code\u003e, find the line that says something like this: \u003ccode\u003e# defoptions=quiet splash\u003c/code\u003e, add \u003ccode\u003eacpi_os_name=Linux\u003c/code\u003e at the end of the line, save\nthe file, and type \u003ccode\u003eupdate-grub\u003c/code\u003e.  Reboot, and viola, it should work normally\nfrom now on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
