It really is a \u003cem\u003emajor\u003c/em\u003e upgrade, and we\ncan't wait to share it with the rest of the OSS community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo word on whether we made it into Karmic or not, but, even if we didn't, it'll\nsurely be in the next Ubuntu release, and I can't wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck out the release announcement on the Exaile \u003ca\nhref='http://www.exaile.org'\u003ehome\u003c/a\u003e page!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
