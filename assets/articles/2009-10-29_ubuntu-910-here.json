On my home\nmachine, work machine, and my HP netbook.  I really haven't had any problems on\nany of them, though only one of them was an upgrade - the other two were fresh\ninstalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, I lied.  I've had one major problem.  \u003ca\nhref='http://www.eveonline.com'\u003eEVE Online\u003c/a\u003e no longer works out of the box\nin Karmic.  After a lot of searching, I've found that if you disable your\nnetwork connection before you start EVE, and reconnect so that you can log in,\nit'll launch and work, but it's still a pain in the ass.  Hopefully they get\nthis resolved soon, so I can shoot some spaceships without disconnecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
