You can save multiple countdowns, and run any number of\nthem at the same time.  When a countdown is done, you can have it alert you,\noptionally by blinking the LED, vibrating, and playing a notification ringtone.\nYou can specify how long the alarm will last before it stops on it's own (to\nsave your battery).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome Screenshots (click on an image to view the full size):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"/media/images/SupaCount/screen_list.png\"\u003e\u003cimg border=\"0\" width=\"200\" src=\"/media/images/SupaCount/screen_list.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"/media/images/SupaCount/screen_edit.png\"\u003e\u003cimg border=\"0\" width=\"200\" src=\"/media/images/SupaCount/screen_edit.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"/media/images/SupaCount/screen_settings.png\"\u003e\u003cimg border=\"0\" width=\"200\" src=\"/media/images/SupaCount/screen_settings.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to publish it here before I publish it to the market.
