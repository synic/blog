I don't suspect that it'll be\na highly successful app, being that it's a utility that most people won't need.\nHowever, being my first app on any of the mobile markets, it'll be interesting\nto see what happens.  There are, at the very least, hundreds of thousands of\npeople (200,000+ people bought a Motorola Droid the first week it was released)\nwith access to the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first impressions of the Android SDK were just from using the platform\nitself.  It seemed great then, just because of the results I could see by\ninstalling other applications (the open nature of it, the ability to replace\nsystem components, etc), but now that I've actually taken a further look at the\ninternals, I like it even more.  It encourages you (if not requires you) to\ncreate highly modular applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the way, I found a great book that I'd like to recommend if you're\nthinking about getting in on Android development.  \u003ca\nhref='http://commonsware.com/'\u003e\u0026quot;The Busy Coder's Guide to Android\nDevelopment\u0026quot;\u003c/a\u003e.  If you buy it at it's very reasonable price, you get free\nupdates to the book when there are new releases of the SDK.  They also have\nkind of a community editing thing going on, you can join the mailing list and\nadd \u0026quot;patches\u0026quot; to the book if you feel so inclined.  You also get \u0026quot;The Busy\nCoders Guide to Advanced Android Development\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEdit (12-22-2009 @ 11:11pm)\u003c/em\u003e:  After one day, the market reports 120 active\ninstalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEdit (12-29-2009 @ 7:20am)\u003c/em\u003e: After eight days, the market reports 272 total\ninstalls, and 172 active installs for a 63% retention rate.  The average rating\nis 4 1/2 stars.  So, even though not many people kept it installed, those that\ndid rated it highly.  This is about what I thought would happen, just because a\nmulti-countdown timer isn't an app that many people would really need.  I think\nI'll get more success if I implement a one off timer that doesn't require you\nto save it before you run it.  This will give it the same feature set as any\nother countdown timer, plus more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
