I found out about  one of the guitar's\ncousins, the Lute. I wondered if people still played it, and looked it up on\nYouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately fell in love.  I liked everything about it.  I loved the music,\nI loved the idea that it was an instrument that people played for hundreds of\nyears.  I loved the way the intrument itself looked.  I loved to listen to it\nand close my eyes, and to be transported to that time in the past.  Maybe\npeople dancing at  a masquerade ball to the music (though, I don't know if that\never happened, or could have happened, being that the lute is a very quiet\ninstrument).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the point is, I was hooked right away.  I started trying to find out\nhow I could get one.  Not an easy task, as only a small group of people play\nthem these days, and an even smaller group make them.  In general, you have to\nget on a luthier's waiting list, pay him a bunch of money, and hopefully you'll\nget a lute at some point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter looking around some, I found a lute player that lived here in Salt Lake\nCity, and called him up.  I went and visited him, and saw some real life\nBaroque Lutes in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually I picked a luthier to make me one, payed the deposit, and got on his\nwaiting list.  After two years of waiting, I got an email from him saying that\nhe had injured his hand, and would no longer be making lutes.  He sent back my\ndeposit, and I was back at square one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around some more for a while, on and off.  I never did get on another\nwaiting list.  Lots of other things were going on in my life (having a kid,\nmoving to and from Seattle, etc).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn December last year, 4 years after I had originally decided I needed a lute,\nI found a luthier that was making the type of lute I wanted (a 13 course\nBaroque Lute), and didn't have a buyer for it yet.  I jumped on board, and sent\nhim the deposit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis brings us to right now.  As of today, I've completely paid for the\nexpensive instrument, he's done making it, and it's just waiting in his\nworkshop in New Zealand for the case to come in so he can ship it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'm sure there'll be more Lute posts in the future, but for now, here's a\npicture he sent to me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://synicworld.com/media/lute.jpg\" alt=\"Lute\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
