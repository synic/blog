Shortly after that, I stopped posting updates for three\nyears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason for this? I lost my signing key. Even if I wanted to make\nupdates to it, I couldn't upload it to the same project on the Android\nMarket, at least, not without a lot of grief. So, I just avoided it...\nthough it wasn't a huge problem. Since I uploaded it, I haven't gotten\none error report in the market dashboard, so it must be working.\nHowever, during that time using it myself, I noticed a few features I've\nwanted here or there that would just make things easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, over the weekend, I rewrote the entire app in Scala. Why a rewrite?\nI dunno, just because I wanted an excuse to learn Scala and Scala for\nAndroid. I've named this one \u0026quot;DupaCount\u0026quot;. \u0026quot;SupaCount\u0026quot; will remain on the\nmarket, but with a blurb that it's been replaced. During the rewrite, I\nadded the few features that I wanted:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you reboot the phone while a timer is running, it will still\nalert as expected. This one really is more of a bug, but people\nprobably didn't notice as most wouldn't make a timer that runs\nlonger than a few hours. I've run timers for up to 2 months before,\nand though they always kept counting down, they wouldn't always\nalert if I had rebooted during that time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere is an easy to see \u0026amp; access button at the bottom of the main\nscreen called \u0026quot;Add Timer\u0026quot;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe \u0026quot;description\u0026quot; field in the Add Timer dialog has been made\noptional. If you leave it blank, it will default to a display of the\ntimer time. This will make it much easier to add a timer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the app can be found here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.synicworld.dupacount\"\u003ehttps://market.android.com/details?id=com.synicworld.dupacount\u003c/a\u003e, and the\nsourcecode can be found here: \u003ca href=\"http://bitbucket.org/synic/dupacount\"\u003ehttp://bitbucket.org/synic/dupacount\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
