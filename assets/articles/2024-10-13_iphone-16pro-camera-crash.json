  "body": "\u003cp\u003eI rely on my phone camera a lot more than I realized. I found this out because\nthe new iphone has a real problem with the camera crashing atm (iOS 18.0.1).\nI've seen lots of posts about it with no real solutions, and I've called Apple\nsupport about it. They didn't seem to know any more than anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem seems to stem from updating from an earlier iPhone, while using an\niCloud backup. This makes sense because not everyone has the issue; this is\nprobably because not everyone upgrades using a backup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat worked for me was going to \u003ccode\u003eSettings-\u0026gt;General-\u0026gt;Transfer or Reset iPhone-\u0026gt;Reset-\u0026gt;Reset All Settings\u003c/code\u003e. Note that this does reset all the iPhone\nsettings, but does NOT delete your data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's a little annoying because you need to set up everything again, but it\nseems to fix the camera crash. For me, this was worth it. Maybe it'll be worth\nit for you too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"update-october-15-2024\"\u003eUPDATE: October 15, 2024 \u003ca class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#update-october-15-2024\"\u003e  Â¶\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis seems to fix all of the issues I was having with the iPhone 16 Pro,\nincluding intermitten performance, battery drain, and overheating (it stands to\nreason they are all related, but who knows)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
