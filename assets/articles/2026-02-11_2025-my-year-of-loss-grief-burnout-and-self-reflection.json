I didn’t know it yet, but this\nwas the day that my life, as I knew it, was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, I didn’t know much at the time. The moment I saw them in there, I\ndissociated. It was instantly like I was watching a horrible movie, not\nparticipating in it. I called 911, and I had a really hard time following their\ninstructions. My brain didn’t seem to work anymore. The police came first and\ntalking to them was pretty difficult. They had lots of questions and I didn’t\nhave a ton of answers. There was no note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy job was gracious enough to let me take 2 months off (a duration I asked\nfor), which I used to plan and have the funeral, be with my family, and try to\nget through this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually I went back to work, and dove head first into a large and\ncomplicated project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-burnout\"\u003eThe Burnout \u003ca class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-burnout\"\u003e  ¶\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put myself into my work. I was absolutely using it to avoid feeling, and\nbefore too long, it was what I was spending most of my time on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began having trouble sleeping, and so I’d open up my laptop and plug away.\nThis was most days, including weekends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the project matured and got closer to release, more people became involved,\nmore coordination, more meetings, more refactoring, and the company wanted to\nstart doing demos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething started to happen to me that I didn’t understand at the time. I had\nremoved all the obstacles and taken the project as far as I could on my own and\nnow I was hitting roadblocks that I could not remove myself. The company was\nvery busy and everyone was working on things. Moreover, not everyone wanted to\nbe working day and night, and so, my defense network of working so I don’t have\nto feel started to crumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started feeling like people were actively trying to prevent me from\nsucceeding. But not just people, everything. Like red lights were red just\nbecause I was there. That GitHub was down specifically for me. I became angry\nand started snapping at my coworkers. Snapping at my pets, my daughter, the guy\nin the park who doesn’t clean up after his dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about quitting. Not just the job but the career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually my manager stepped in and suggested I take some more time off. At\nthis point something had to give, so I agreed. I went and saw my doctor, told\nhim, my therapist, and my psychologist what was going on. My doctor recommended\nthat I take 12 weeks of FMLA leave as the prescription for Burnout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of today, I have about 2 weeks left of that leave, and yesterday was the\nfirst time I touched my laptop (or any computer) during leave. I wanted to\nwrite up this post to let people know what’s going on and to explain my\nexperience, maybe it can help someone else in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"self-reflection\"\u003eSelf Reflection \u003ca class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#self-reflection\"\u003e  ¶\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately after the funeral, I tried finding a therapist. I knew I was in\ntrouble, and though I hadn’t really had any good experiences with therapy, I\nwas fairly determined. It felt like a life and death situation to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn't easy to find one, but eventually I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first couple of visits were a little awkward. I was pretty skeptical\nto start out due to my previous experiences, and when she had me playing\nwith sand and painting pictures, I wondered if it was going to help at\nall or just be an awkward waste of money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the third visit, something changed. I’m not sure if it was her or me that\nsuggested it, but that day we decided to spend the hour on a walk around her\nneighborhood. For whatever reason, this worked for me. I’ve been seeing her\nonce a week since then, and we've spent the hour walking every single time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you hear about something like this happening to someone, I don’t think\npeople usually consider the whole reality of the situation. Or at least I\ndidn’t. Maybe you think, “oh that’s terrible I don’t know how I could lose\nanyone I am close to” but it’s more than that. When you lose your partner, you\ndon’t just lose them and the interactions you had and would have had with them,\nyou lose the life you were building together — your very future. There is a\nversion of “you” that only they knew, and that’s gone too. You lose your\npurpose. Like I said in the intro, my entire \u003cem\u003elife\u003c/em\u003e, as I knew it, was over. It\nis very disorienting. I didn’t know what to do with myself. I was full of grief\nand everything I thought I was working for seemed to end. I was lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy doctor told me the leave didn't mean I should stay home and do all\nthe things I didn't have time to do before, like fixing the bathroom\nsink or cleaning the house. I should be relaxing, avoiding stress,\nand going easy on myself. Absolutely no work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sounds fine on paper, but I’ll tell you one thing, there isn’t much that\ncan prepare you for how you feel when you’ve been going at 110% for as long as\nyou can remember, to suddenly stopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou wake up, you lay in bed, and you think “\u003cem\u003enow what?\u003c/em\u003e” “\u003cem\u003eWhat the hell am I\nsupposed to do???\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is extremely unsettling, and it left me laying there with only my thoughts\nfor the first few days. The thoughts I was avoiding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy partner was sick for years. They became extremely anxious during the\npandemic and never really got over it. They became agoraphobic and never left\nthe house. They lost interest in doing things that we did before, and\neventually, it felt like they lost interest in us, too. In the meantime, I did\nmost of the work. I paid the mortgage, I drove our daughter to school, I did\nthe housework, took pets to the vet, etc etc, even when they didn’t seem to\nhave anything left for me. Furthermore, they didn’t seem interested in fixing\nit. I became resentful. I started coming to terms with the thought that my life\njust wasn’t going to be what I hoped it would. But I didn’t leave, I just\nthought it was what I deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a very long time before I was able to stop blaming myself for my\npartner’s suicide. That it was not my fault. That I did do everything I could,\nand more, and even beyond what I should have been doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, how could I be giving more than I should and still feel like it was my\nfault? Well that’s easy. Because I never feel like I’m doing a good enough job.\nI never have, in any aspect of my life, even the things I’m best at. There have\nbeen times (plural) when I thought I was getting fired and instead got a raise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst part is, I wasn’t unaware of it. I knew there was a disconnect\nbetween reality and my mind when it came to viewing myself in a positive light,\nbut knowing it didn’t change anything. I thought that was just how I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started therapy, I thought it was going to be more “I just need to talk\nto someone because my life is really dark right now and I don’t know how to\ncope”, not “I need to find out why I am the way I am so I can be who I want to\nbe”, but I guess that’s just how it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough my therapy, my doctor, and even random therapy shorts on TikTok (I\nbasically hopescroll TikTok now), I’ve found that what happened to me isn’t all\nthat uncommon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat people like me can experience an \u0026quot;awakening\u0026quot; in their 40s where\neverything that seemed to matter before suddenly doesn't anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found a talk on exactly this, and if any of what I’ve been saying here is\nhitting home for you, I urge you to listen to it. First time I heard it I\nwatched it several times in a row with tears in my eyes:\n\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/CvJUlRaL0fY?si=GnwHGQXEP3HigN8n\"\u003eAlan Watts: Why Life Actually Begins at 40\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEssentially he’s saying that before 40, you’re often living the life you\nthought you were supposed to have, the one your parents would have been proud\nof. The one society approves of. The one you think you \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e be living. You\nhave the values you were assigned, not the ones that really mattered the most\nto you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy therapist gave the following analogy: Billy is given an Easter basket for\nEaster. Inside are the usual things: toys and sweets. What toys and sweets?\nWhy, the ones his parent put in there, of course! There’s candy corn, malted\nmilk eggs, and tootsie rolls. Unfortunately, Billy doesn’t like tootsie rolls.\nOh well, he’s not about to complain, candy is candy. It happens year after year\nuntil Billy is grown. Billy was never asked what he wanted in his basket, and\nhe never considered that he could request other items. Eventually Billy is\ngrown, on his own, and has to fill his own basket. He doesn’t really know\nwhat’s available so he just fills it with the same stuff his mom did, and he\ncontinues to eat the tootsie rolls even though he doesn’t really like them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe basket is your life, and the things that are in it are \u003cem\u003evalues\u003c/em\u003e. When we\nare children, our values are given to us. We don’t get to choose. At some\npoint, we should pick our own values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was me. My entire life, I was working toward values I thought I should\nhave, even when they were sometimes in contention with what I felt. When my\npartner was suddenly gone, a lot of the things I was doing in life seemed\npointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cannot express how disorienting this is. How tough it is to see a future when\nthe one you thought you had is ripped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout therapy, I’m not sure I’d have been able to move on from that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my doctor said “12 weeks no work” I couldn’t see how 10 years, let alone\n12 weeks would fix this. How it could even put a dent in it. And I felt that\nway until just a week or so ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can honestly say, though, that I do feel quite a bit better. Over time, the\n“life or death” feeling I’ve had about everything over the last couple decades\nof my life has started to lift a bit. That things don’t feel so dire. That\nsometimes I can look back and feel grateful for what I had and will have\ninstead of being full of resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still haven’t figured out everything I’d like in my basket, but at least I\nknow it’s entirely my choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
