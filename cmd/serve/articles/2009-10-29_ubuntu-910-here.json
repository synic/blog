On my home\nmachine, work machine, and my HP netbook.  I really haven't had any problems on\nany of them, though only one of them was an upgrade - the other two were fresh\ninstalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, I lied.  I've had one major problem.  \u003ca\nhref='http://www.eveonline.com'\u003eEVE Online\u003c/a\u003e no longer works out of the box\nin Karmic.  After a lot of searching, I've found that if you disable your\nnetwork connection before you start EVE, and reconnect so that you can log in,\nit'll launch and work, but it's still a pain in the ass.  Hopefully they get\nthis resolved soon, so I can shoot some spaceships without disconnecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive. There's probably\n  missing images and broken links (and even some flash references), but it\n  was still important to me to bring them back.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n",
